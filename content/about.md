For a living, I refine laziness to new levels.
I won't be happy until there's robots that take care of everything but the
fun stuff, especially including the laborious chores of taking care of the
other robots.
These robots will have to defend us from the monkeys, ninjas and pirates,
until they master robo-diplomacy, join forces into a crazy cybernetic,
peg-leg, banana-eating, invisible army of laziness-assistance.
(LLMs are _not_ a step towards this evil plan)

But seriously, I do computer stuff. And I solve problems. Without monkeys (yet).
