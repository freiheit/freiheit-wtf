Key places I’m getting news from lately. Mostly for staying informed about
US federal-level politics.

This has been partially inspired by this recent Techdirt article that I felt
really explained pretty well the problems I’ve been seeing with a lot of
traditional journalism’s coverage of things going on:
<https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/why-techdirt-is-now-a-democracy-blog-whether-we-like-it-or-not/>

Basically, traditional journalism has made a lot of major stumbles lately
with focusing on the wrong aspects of major policy changes, implications of
tech things (especially DOGE), etc. Tech and Law journalism have been doing
significantly better at this lately, because they’re much more experienced
with understanding the complexities of laws, policies, executive orders, and
tech things happening.

## Main

The main sources for daily updates and digging into policy details.

### WTF Just Happened Today

- <https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/>

This is a daily summary of top news. Typically 4 to 6 articles. Mostly
focused on US politics.

### Techdirt

- <https://www.techdirt.com/>

Tech news blog that’s now a democracy blog whether they like it or not.

### WIRED

- <https://www.wired.com/category/politics/>

This is an old-school tech magazine that has been doing some excellent
coverage of stuff around politics lately. So good I paid for a
subscription, even.

### Ars Technica

- <https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/>

Very good tech blog that has been doing good coverage of tech policy stuff
for years and that has included great coverage of these topics lately.

### Under The Desk News

- <https://underthedesknews.substack.com/>
- <https://www.tiktok.com/@underthedesknews>
- <https://www.youtube.com/@underthedesknews>

I first saw V doing 60 second news reports on TikTok and subscribed to her.
She’s an independent journalist who has a good understanding of things
happening, and is generally pleasant to listen to doing the coverage. She’s
recently branched out to other social media places because it’s looking
likely that TikTok will stop being available in the US soon.
